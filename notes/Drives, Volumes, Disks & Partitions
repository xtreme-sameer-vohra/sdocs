**Drives, Volumes, Disks & Partitions**


**Drive** 
Physical storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state disk, removable USB flash drive etc. In Unix-like operating systems devices are represented by special file system objects called device nodes which are visible under the  `/dev directory`

**Partions**
A physical storage device can be divided into multiple logical storage units known as partitions. 

**Volume**
The term volume in Linux is related to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM), which can be used to manage mass storage devices. A physical volume is a storage device or partition. A logical volume created by the LVM is a logical storage device which can span multiple physical volumes.

*Volume* implies formatting while a *partition* does not
