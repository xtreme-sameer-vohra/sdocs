Taxes on stock options are calculated based on *Excercise Price* and *Strike Price*. 
50 % of the delta is taxed under income (*Stock Option Deduction*)
However, if the shares are sold at a later date for a price lower than the *Excercise Price* the loses are counted under *Capital Gains* and therefore may not be used to offset *Income* from *Excercising*

**Conclusion** Perform a Cashless excercise ASAP and then use the cash to re buy if desired
