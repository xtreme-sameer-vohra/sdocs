# Alyship 
- is defined in the moment, not a badge that can be worn
- the stance taken in the moment by a person, as seen from the perspective of the person who is expected to benefit from it

# Referrals
- average white person knows less than < 1 black person, this perpetuates the status quo and doesn't allow for more diversity


# Responsibility
- the system is broken, the onus to correct the system is on the leaders and folks in the position of priviledge
- it isn't on the folks that are victimized, they may be struggling to just get by
- when asking someone who is under represented for knowledge/info, ask for permission first, recognize its a favor and not an obligation for the person to provide the info
- take responsibility for educating yourself, don't expect others to educate you, it isn't their job
