# Tyranny of Structurelessness by Jo Freeman
[Reference](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)

- No structure in group is bad
	- it creates the space for elitism
	```
	 If the movement continues deliberately to not select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do exercise power and influence be responsible for it.
	 ```
	- wastes good will/energy
	- creates `in` and `out` groups within the group as information/connections are tribal and not explicit

- The principles are clear and concise
	- Rotation of tasks aims at striking the right balance of control vs mastery


## Questions
 - This statement should mean that the group hasn't suffered as a result of elites with informal structure but is susceptible. That doesn't make it feel that its the most in need for structure.
  ```
  Their informal structures have not been too well formed and adherence to the ideology of "structurelessness" makes them reluctant to change tactics. The more Unstructured a group is, the more lacking it is in informal structures, and the more it adheres to an ideology of "structurelessness," the more vulnerable it is to being taken over by a group of political comrades.
